# DFA_Based_Song_Identification
A DFA based Song Identification within videos, movies etc. Implementation

There is no significant attention paid to the song segments of the movie while studying, categorizing and indexing movies and studying the characteristics of the songs themselves. This project aims at automatically detecting music and song sequences in movies. It defines a grammar that a musical sequence typically follows by means of a finite state machine. It also proposes a system that exploits audio-visual low level features to extract songs from a movie.
